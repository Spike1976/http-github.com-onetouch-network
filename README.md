## **Features**
1. **Split-Distribute-Reassemble (SDR):**
   - Splits data (e.g., votes or transactions) into randomized parts.
   - Routes parts through multiple proxy addresses.
   - Reassembles data securely on the target side for privacy and anonymity.

2. **Biometric Authentication:**
   - Secure access via fingerprints, retina scans, or voice recognition.
   - Local hashing ensures user privacy.

3. **Decentralized Identity (DID) Management:**
   - Self-sovereign identities managed securely via blockchain.
   - Eliminates reliance on centralized identity systems.

4. **Proxy Address Routing:**
   - Enhances anonymity by dynamically routing data through proxy nodes.

5. **Blockchain Transparency:**
   - Built on the XRP Ledger for scalable, low-cost transactions.
   - Immutable records for accountability and trust.

6. **Open-Source Collaboration:**
   - Accessible source code invites contributions and customizations.

Features

Split-Distribute-Reassemble (SDR): Ensures privacy by splitting transactions or votes into parts, routing them through proxy addresses, and securely reassembling them.

Biometric Authentication: Provides secure access through fingerprints, retina scans, or voice recognition.

Decentralized Identity (DID) Management: Empowers users with cryptographically secure, self-sovereign identities.

Proxy Address Routing: Enhances privacy with randomized proxy routing.

Blockchain Integration: Built on the XRP Ledger for high-speed, low-cost transactions.

Open-Source Collaboration: Welcomes contributions to enhance functionality and customization.
